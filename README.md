# exercise-generator

My first ever .Net Application, written in C#

This is a simple CLI Application that lets you generate workout exercises. When started you are asked to eather enter character A or B. A for a simple workout and B for a
harder workout. Based on which option you choose a workout with 5 different excersises are generated.
